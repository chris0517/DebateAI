Yesterday: Finished setting up jest and cypress for the project.\
Today: Insert all debate topics into the SQL database, try to set up code in server.js to fetch info from the database.\
Difficulties Encountered: How to add icons as jpg to the sql database, or if there's a better way to save the icons.
